------------ INTRO -----------

* A scala is a type-safe JVM language.
 --> Type safe means at the time of compilation of code , compiler will validates types and throw an
 	 exception if a wrong type assigned to a variable.
 	 
* It incorporates(includes) both Object-Oriented and functional programming into an extremely concise,
  high level and expressive languages.
  
* Provides frameWorks like Apache Spark for data processing .

??? What is a functional programming?

--> It's a programming pattern that uses functions as a building blocks of a program. 

??? Properties of a function

--> A function should be always REFERENTIAL TRANSPARENT , it means a function should always return the 
	same result and the expression can be replace by the result.
	Example : 3 + 4 = 7 
	Here , 3 + 4 is a expression and it can be replace by result.
	
--> A function should be totally pure , means there should be no side effects of using that function and should 
	return only result.
	
--> An impure function interacts with the state of the program and can cause side effects. 
	States like mutable object , a variable etc.

??? Functions as a First-Class Citizens

--> In scala, every function is a value and the functions act as a first-class citizens.
